 Final Project for Drawing on the Web

## Theme
The project consists of three drawings, each illustrating a beautiful different time of day: sunrise, rainfall in the afternoon, and nighttime.

## Navigation Page
The user navigates to each of the three drawings using a clock on the navigation page, following the main theme of time. I really enjoy minimalistic, classic clock faces.
### Draft 1
I created a bare-bones, ugly clock with a non-functional hour hand. I decided on just having roman numerals for 4 different hours, because I thought it would make the nicest looking clock.
Work will have to be done to get the color of the clock face right. I think I will either go with a different, softer hue of grey, or maybe even a light bronze.
I will also have to find a different, more stylistic font for the numbers on the face.
One of the challenges of animating will be translating the hour hand the correct number of pixels as it rotates around the different times.

## Sunrise page
The focus of this page will be, of course, the sun rising. I strove to make the animation as smooth and as balanced as I could. I also decided to give it a little x-translation, because suns rarely just rise straight up.
The sky will also change into different hues of blue, orange and red as the sun rises.
### Draft 1
I got a very basic sun-rising animation on a simple colored background. It wasn't much work getting all the elements into place.
I foresee that my main challenge may be coloring the sky in a pretty way. I am looking for possibly lighter, pastel shades, that are still very colorful - possibly something like Taylor Swift's Lover album shades, a mix of pink, purple, blue, and the lightest of oranges.
